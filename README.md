# Multilayer-Perceptron-Library
   ![mlp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22057690/33873747-0ed65c20-ded1-11e7-921d-9d409770a39a.jpg)
    
The library contains MLP objects for two-class classification and regression which are trained by backpropagation algorithm. The network objects include severeal parameters which can be tuned to modify network for different machine learning problems e.g. the number of hidden layers, the number of hidden neurons, activation function etc.. The whole project is built from scratch using python 3 without any external library dependencies.
