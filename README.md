# Artificial-Neural-Network-Package
    A multi-layer perceptron library. The library contains a MLP class for classification and another for regression. The network is trained by basic backpropagation algorithm. User can define the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons of the network and choose between a few activation functions and choose between static and constant learning rate.

    The whole network and algorithm are built from scratch using python 3 without any external library 
    dependencies.
