# backpropagation-feedforward-ANN
    A multi-layer perceptron library. The library contains a MLP class for binary classifying and another for regression. The network is trained by neural basic backpropagation algorithm. User can define the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons of the network and choose between a few activation functions.

    The whole network and algorithm are built from scratch using python 3 without any external library 
    dependencies.

## scripts:
-`FF_ANN_backpropagation.py`: implementation of the network and algorithm

## TODO:
- Extension to multiclass classifier
