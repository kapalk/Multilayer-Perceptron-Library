# backpropagation-feedforward-ANN
    A feedforward neural network binary classifier which is trained using basic backpropagation algorithm.
    The whole network and algorithm are built from scratch using python 3.5 without any external library 
    dependencies.

## scripts:
-`FF_ANN_backpropagation.py`: implementation of the network and algorithm

## TODO:
- Extension to multiclass classifier
- different activation functions
- Version for regression
