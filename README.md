## A multi-layer perceptron library. 
The library contains a MLP class for classification and another for regression. The network is trained by basic backpropagation algorithm. Classes contain severeal parameters which can be tuned to modify network for different purposes e.g. the number of hidden layers, the number of hidden neurons, activation function etc.. The whole network and algorithm are built from scratch using python 3 without any external library dependencies.
